# ==================== Discord Message Backupper =========================
# SYNOPSIS
# Uses Python along with Discord's API to retrieve all messages from all channels visible to the BOT

# USAGE
# 1. Replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE at the end of this script with your bot token
# 2. Messages will be saved to text files in the same directory as the script

    formatted_timestamp = re.sub(r'\.\d+(\+|-)\d{2}:\d{2}$', '', formatted_timestamp)

# Define a function to save data to a file
